I can talk any time this week except T 10-11:30 and Th 11:30-4; any time 5/23-26

Here’s my list of datasets. Let’s talk about where we would prefer more detailed input data, and which cases of “how much does local and refined data matter?” we want to evaluate in the publication. I have a volunteer planning student working on UrbanSim this summer who can contribute with ways to incorporate Public Use Microdata Sample and other surveys. The travel applet at http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/projects/cityspeed estimates travel speed, congestion, distance, and trip complexity, from which we can derive active transport time and feasibility.

My talking points for our call:

programming and software work plan
expected results and analyses (including derived stats) required for each MSA
other data needs
evaluation plan?

I’m glad to provide a first guess for each.

Scott
